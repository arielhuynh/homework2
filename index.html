                      <p>Hey now, hey now, this is what dreams are made of! I was born in 1993 and am obsessed with anything from the late 90's to the early 2000's. What are my favorite songs you ask? I still rock out to Nsync, Backstreet, or Paula DeAnda in my car. Nothing like a little Blu Cantrell setting the tone for the day! I love singing while driving- it makes time go by faster. However, I have been told I am tone deaf my a family member so unfortunately not everyone gets to hear my musical talents.
                      </p>
                      <p>Currently I am working full time at a medical device company. What got me intrigued in coding was working with our IT team redesigning the application used by my team. Since they are the only IT team for our whole company, it takes them quite a bit of time to get to the IT ticket. Since the changes that I am trying to implement are focused on making the technician's job easier and mistake-proof, I am very eager to get it started.
