This website was made so I can tell people a little about myself and my background and why I decided to take coding bootcamp. I wish I could show you my first website that I created when doing the prework- it is pretty embarassing. I showed my brother and he laughed in my face. I have learned a lot of things from starting boot camp and my website is significantly better than my fan page website.
Putting texts and images in containers makes a drastic difference.
